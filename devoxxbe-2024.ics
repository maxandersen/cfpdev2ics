 - Build & Deploy - INTERMEDIATE</a><br><br>While the Gradle Build Tool has 
 been around for a while\, it continuously evolves. The next major version\
 , Gradle 9\, brings a couple of key features that will impact users and th
 e ecosystem.<br>For users\, the focus is on two tracks: scalability and co
 mprehensibility. For scalability\, the Gradle team aims to deliver feature
 s that make builds as fast as possible\, even for massive projects. For co
 mprehensibility\, it is all about making Gradle easier to adopt and use fo
 r teams of all sizes and skill levels.<br>Offering all of the above will r
 equire the plugin ecosystem to match the updated Gradle APIs and patterns\
 , including stronger constraints\, which are required to continue offering 
 the strongest reliability guarantees.<br>This session will cover topics li
 ke:<br><ul><li>Continued investment in configuration caching\,</li><li>Upc
 oming isolated projects feature\,</li><li>Higher level modeling of softwar
 e projects\,</li><li>Separation of concerns for build users and build auth
 ors</li></ul>All of these topics will be illustrated by released features 
 available in the Gradle 8.x line and by looking at what is coming in 9.0 a
 nd beyond. Both build users and plugin authors will learn what to do now a
 nd tomorrow to leverage the most of Gradle 9.<br><br>Speakers:<br>Louis Ja

 ealizing-one-is-wrong">Deep Dive - Java - INTERMEDIATE</a><br><br>The inte
 rnet is full of micro benchmarks explaining the world to beginners. Everyo
 ne able to use JMH is trying to explain the world\, but only a few do it r
 ight. Most benchmarks are either entirely wrong\, or draw the wrong conclu
 sions. We're going on a journey to discover and question published microbe
 nchmarks\, figure out when you need your own\, and decide when you shouldn
 't run any.<br>The presentation begins with a straightforward introduction 
 to microbenchmarking\, using a simple approach that anyone can grasp. You 
 will gain insights into potential pitfalls and learn how to avoid them\, e
 nsuring the validity of benchmark results. By the end of the presentation\
 , you will not only be equipped with the skills to conduct meaningful micr
 obenchmarking\, but also develop a critical eye for evaluating the validit
 y of results from others.<br>Besides the obvious microbenchmarking tools a
 nd techniques\, you will also learn a lot about the inner workings of the 
 JVM\, your hardware\, and how they interact with each other. At the end\, 
 you will hopefully be able to make the call whether microbenchmarking is n
 eeded at all in your daily work.<br><br>Speakers:<br>Ren√© Schwietzke<br><b

 inding one. We departed from the 'classic threads' station and traveled th
 rough Runnables\, ExecutorService\, CompletableFutures and ForkJoinPools\, 
 before finally arriving at 'virtual threads'. But does 'finally' mean that 
 we've arrived at our final destination\, or is it a transfer at best?<br>N
 ow that virtual threads are available\, our Java programs will likely use 
 an abundance of threads. This increase in thread count will immediately ma
 ke thread coordination\, observability and isolation more difficult. Two n
 ew Java features are currently in development that might make things a bit 
 easier: Structured Concurrency and Scoped Values.<br>In this Deep-Dive\, w
 e'll introduce and demonstrate these new features\, and how they can help 
 address the challenges that have emerged since the introduction of virtual 
 threads. We'll also discuss how the availability of these features will im
 pact your day-to-day programming life and whether Java's concurrency journ
 ey is actually over now that these features have become available or if th
 ere are still more stops to come. (and of course there will be live demos!

DESCRIPTION:<a href="https://devoxx.be/talk/from-native-code-gems-to-java-t
 reasures-with-jextract">Tools-in-Action - Java - BEGINNER</a><br><br>When 
 developing a Java application\, there can be use cases when you need acces
 s to system-level APIs and libraries written in other programming language
 s ( C\, OpenGL\, Tensorflow\, Rust\, Python\, etc.). Project Panama is des
 igned to facilitate access to native libraries\, particularly those develo
 ped in C/C++\, from Java code. <br><br>Interaction between the JVM and the 
 &quot\;foreign&quot\; (non-Java) APIs has been made simpler with Foreign F
 unction and Memory API (FFM API). The FFM API became a final feature in JD
 K 22\, and it comes with a little gem - the jextract tool - that can autom
 ate obtaining access to native code. jextract parses header files (.h) of 
 native libraries and generates Java code\, named bindings that use the FFM 
 API internally. <br><br>This talk will walk you through how easy it is to 
 work with jextract and how to directly use its output as a Java model of t
 he native libraries you are interested in.<br><br>Speakers:<br>Ana-Maria M

 ting or doing interactive experiments with Java:<br><ul><li>JShell - termi
 nal</li><li>Jupyter with Java Kernel - Web based</li><li>JDoodle - web bas

 s interactive experience to write Java code\, interact with the results us
 ing a full graphical interface and all this without the tedious process of 
 compiling and running every time you make a small change achieving a light
 weight rapid development cycle. JTaccuino is based on running embedded JSh
 ell tooling for executing the Java code and provides a library and some pa
 ckaged default tooling (JTaccuino Pad\, JTaccuino Studio) to allow for max
 imum flexibility and for direct use or integration in existing environment
 s. For the graphical frontend JTaccuino uses JavaFX.<br>JTaccuino uses the 
 the Jupyter notebook format (ipynb) for persistence to leverage the source 
 code rendering support e.g. on GitHub.<br>The session will demo the use of 
 JTaccuino and shows different examples of Jupyter like notebooks in Java w
 ith applications from<br><ul><li>quantum computing simulation using Strang
 e</li><li>charting using different charting solutions 2D and 3D</li><li>da
 ta science examples using a Java data frame library (Tablesaw)</li></ul>Du
 ring the demo a special interest will be to show how a tight integration o
 f a library\, e.g. JavaFX charting solutions\, can be achieved. This will 
 enhance the overall user experience by adding magic things to the running 
 JShell environment like the automatic display of special variable content.

 .<br>In this session\, we‚Äôll take several examples of pattern matching and 
 pose them as questions for the audience.&nbsp\;Sometimes\, the results are 
 not what you would expect.&nbsp\;For each example\, we‚Äôll discuss the logi

DESCRIPTION:<a href="https://devoxx.be/talk/the-cycling-tour-java-s-fraught
 -relationship-with-cyclic-object-graphs">Conference - Java - ADVANCED</a><
 br><br>A Java program consists of objects that have references to each oth
 er. This is called the "object graph." It's easy to set up an object graph 
 with cycles. If you do this\, some things work\, but other things break\, 
 sometimes in a surprising fashion. Cyclic object graphs don't come up very 
 often\, but when they do\, they often result in difficult and subtle probl
 ems. Worse\, the JDK doesn't provide much help here.<br>Garbage collection 
 works perfectly with cyclic object graphs. Early reference-counted GCs had 
 problems with cycles\, but modern tracing collectors handle them perfectly 
 fine. This is a solved problem.<br>The picture is less rosy in other parts 
 of the system. A cyclic object graph using records or collections often re
 sults in a stack overflow or out-of-memory error.<br>Java serialization cl
 aims to support cyclic object graphs. This works only in the simplest of c
 ases. In more complex cases\, deserialization will fail in subtle and unpl
 easant ways. There is a whole family of bug reports in the JDK Bug System 
 that represents these different failure modes.<br>I'll show several exampl
 es of cyclic object graphs that cause failures\, and I'll explain these fa
 ilures. I'll also explain why it's very difficult for the JDK to do anythi
 ng effective to prevent them.<br>Yet there are times when it's useful for 
 Java applications to represent relationships that have cycles. I'll descri
 be a set of techniques that can be used to represent cycles and that avoid 
 the problems I've described.<br><br>Speakers:<br>Stuart Marks<br><br>Favou

 br>Now\, out of the blue\, a bunch of "thought leaders" (all with an opera

 YAML\, Docker\, Kubernetes\, and Terraform to deploy our software because 
 suddenly it is our concern?!<br>In this talk\, we'll discuss why Java deve
 lopers do or don‚Äôt need DevOps. We'll consider arguments made by DevOps vi
 sionaries and see whether they hold water. Hopefully\, by the end of the t

 basically needed to rework the app to run on a new framework\, in essence 
 retrofitting Spring Boot underneath. (The Apache Causeway framework does t

 application performance can be something of a dark art. In addition to per

 erformance indicators.<br>In this presentation\, I will review a number of 
 axes of application performance\, with a filter of optimizing workload per
 formance on Arm64 processors. That starts with performance improvements in 
 the JVM: out-of-the-box performance on Arm64 improved by 30% between Java 
 11 and Java 21. I will share some of the improvements integrated by Oracle 
 that led to these improvements\, which will give some insight into perform
 ance-related architectural differences.<br>Beyond JVM improvements\, there 
 are also numerous JVM configuration options that can have a dramatic effec
 t on application performance\, including JVM ergonomics around garbage col
 lection and heap size that are often sub-optimal for a long-running cloud 
 workload that expects to have access to almost all the resources of a VM\, 
 configuration options around memory page size that can differ across diffe
 rent compute architectures\, and efficient usage of JVM threads to optimiz
 e consumption of hardware resources.<br>One layer beneath that\, it is pos
 sible to tune operating system configuration to allow the JVM to make more 
 effective use of system resources by matching JVM page size to kernel memo
 ry page size\, optimizing various system parameters related to system thre
 ads\, I/O\, or networking to reduce the time that that the operating syste
 m is the bottleneck for your application.<br>To show the impact of some of 
 these settings\, I will use some performance analysis and debugging tools 
 to show how you can figure out good (perhaps not optimal) values for sizin

 BEGINNER</a><br><br>Platform engineering is often associated with infrastr
 ucture and operations engineers striving to manage the complexities of Kub
 ernetes\, cloud environments\, and their ecosystems. However\, its impact 
 on application developers is equally profound. In this session\, we will s
 hift the focus to how platform engineering can significantly enhance the d
 eveloper experience and boost productivity within development teams.<br>&n
 bsp\;<br>Platform engineering is not just about getting applications into 
 production\; it is about creating a comprehensive environment that support
 s application developers throughout the entire software development lifecy
 cle. By providing robust\, self-service platforms\, platform engineering r
 educes the cognitive load on developers\, allowing them to concentrate on 
 building and delivering high-quality applications. We'll explore practical 
 examples and case studies demonstrating how platform engineering can strea
 mline workflows\, simplify environments\, and provide developers with the 
 tools they need to excel.<br>&nbsp\;<br>Moreover\, platform engineering ca
 n offer environments powered by generative AI that support developers' met
 hodologies\, and virtualized development environments that facilitate codi
 ng and unit testing anytime\, anywhere. It can also ensure continuous depl
 oyment to the platform\, optimizing the application execution environment. 
 This presentation will discuss what and how platform engineering can provi
 de developers with the functionality they need and find useful.<br><br>Spe

 st practices\, including security constraints\, design patterns\, accessib
 ility\, and technical decisions. Moreover\, maximizing the benefits of AI 
 requires highly skilled individuals who can establish clear standards and 
 critically evaluate the AI&#39\;s output.<br>At Packmind\, we aim to tackl
 e this challenge by accelerating developers‚Äô skill growth through AI coach
 ing and by integrating team best practices with AI coding assistants.<br>I
 n this session\, we will explore how teams can easily and continuously def
 ine and maintain their development standards\, and how AI can help extract 
 those standards from the current codebase. Once these standards are establ
 ished\, AI can assist in enforcing them\, help train the entire team\, and 
 generate code that aligns with validated human expertise. Through concrete 
 examples\, we will demonstrate how AI can become a true co-pilot for the t

 restricting its applicability. The StableValue rectifies this imbalance be
 tween internal and client code by providing safe wrappers around the `@Sta
 ble` annotation. Hence\, all the important benefits of `@Stable` are now m
 ade available to regular Java developers and third-party library developer
 s.<br>The Foreign Function &amp\; Memory API (the FFM API)\, introduced in 
 Java 22\, provides access to structured memory. Sadly\, only access to pri
 mitive values like `int` and `long` were available. SegmentMapper fixes th
 is shortcoming and allows structured memory to be mapped to standard Java 
 composites like `record` classes\, thereby significantly improving the ver

 pplications. Selenium WebDriver (usually called simply Selenium)\, the mai
 n component of the Selenium project\, automates browsers by providing an A
 pplication Programming Interface (API) in different programming languages. 
 The latest stable version of Selenium is version 4\, released in October 2
 021. Many things have changed since then\, and the Selenium project (to wh
 ich I belong as an active committer) is currently working on the next majo
 r release: Selenium 5. This talk provides an overview of the most relevant 
 features to be shipped in this new major version using Java as the program
 ming language.<br>To that aim\, first\, I will introduce the required setu
 p to start developing Selenium tests\, including build tools (Maven\, Grad
 le)\, unit testing framework (JUnit 4/5\, TestNG)\, or assertion libraries 
 (like AssertJ).<br>Then\, I present Selenium Manager\, a helper tool fully 
 integrated into Selenium to ease the development of Selenium scripts by pr
 oviding automated driver management. This feature has been implemented tha
 nks to the lessons learned in the maintenance of WebDriverManager (i.e.\, 
 the automated driver management library for Java)\, and it is available in 
 all the Selenium languages. In addition to driver management\, Selenium Ma
 nager provides automated browser management (for instance\, based on Chrom
 e-for-Testing -CfT-).<br>Then\, I explain another hot topic to be shipped 
 in Selenium 5: the WebDriver bidirectional (BiDi) protocol. The WebDriver 
 BiDi is a W3C draft that defines the bidirectional WebDriver protocol. Web
 Driver BiDi will allow different operations using a fast bidirectional tra
 nsport (i.e.\, without polling the browser to get responses). In Selenium\
 , the aim is for BiDi to be a standardized replacement for advanced operat
 ions currently supported by the non-standard Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP
 ).<br>Finally\, I discuss the importance of the Selenium ecosystem. Seleni
 um has become central to existing libraries\, testing frameworks\, and oth
 er tools.<br><br>Speakers:<br>Boni Garc√≠a<br><br>Favourites:<br>69<br><br>

 br>With a "Co-pilot for everything\," our interaction with technology and 
 daily tasks is evolving. Organizations are increasingly integrating LLMs i
 nto their applications\, enhancing features like search tools\, chatbots\, 
 and internal information systems.<br>Chances are\, you're already working 
 with Generative AI or will be soon. But are you aware of the risks before 
 diving into use cases or development? Curiosity drives us to explore limit
 s\, which can lead to finding ways around "Guard Rails." These guard rails 
 prevent misuse\, like asking ChatGPT how to build a bomb. But what if clev
 er wordplay confuses LLMs into bypassing these safeguards?<br>In "The dark 
 arts of Prompt Engineering\," we'll explore Prompt Injections. We'll cover 
 what Guard Rails are\, how they function\, and how to circumvent them usin
 g Prompt Injections‚Äîpurely for educational purposes. Understanding these r
 isks is crucial for knowing where to implement safeguards or reconsider ac
 tions. This session goes beyond tech details. It‚Äôs about real-life impacts
 . You'll see examples that will make you rethink AI's role in our lives. W
 e'll also discuss the ethical aspect‚Äîhow to use AI responsibly and safely. 
 Plus\, learn a fun trick: hide some "words as weapons" in your CV to trick 
 recruiters!<br>As AI is here to stay\, let's get secure and join this sess

 - ADVANCED</a><br><br>Just as development should be iterative\, software d
 esign should change when the context and our understanding of the problem 
 evolve. As a software grows to solve more problems\, it becomes less suppl
 e in its ability to evolve. Tensions arise within the business model of th
 e software that struggles to stay coherent.<br>Eventually it reaches a cri
 tical mass and becomes a monolith of spaghetti code. How do we know when i
 t‚Äôs time to modularize our software? How do we carry on the decision to sp
 lit it into several modules or services? How can we handle the progressive 
 differenciation of our business models while avoiding unnecessary coupling
 ? It‚Äôs not as easy as a clean axe cut in the middle\, finding the right bo
 undaries can be tricky.<br>We would like to introduce the Model Mitosis\, 
 a dynamic approach used to split a business model into multiple ones that 
 will get shaped and decoupled iteratively. Gain flexibility to choose bett
